# Work In Progress!

Part I. View + Visualize Tokens that gets emitted by [GLSL-Tokenizer](https://github.com/stackgl/glsl-tokenizer/). This somewhat performs as GLSL Syntax highlighter.

Part II. Visualize AST after passing tokens through [GLSL-Parser]()

Part III. Analyse AST and scope. Remove unrequired AST nodes.

Part IV. Generate clean GLSL code!
